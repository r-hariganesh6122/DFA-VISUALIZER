DFA Visualizer

Welcome to the DFA Visualizer â€“ an interactive web application for creating, visualizing, and testing Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). Explore how DFAs work step by step and test input strings in real time!

ğŸ”— **Try it here:** [DFA Visualizer Website](https://dfa-visualizer.vercel.app/)  

ğŸŒŸ Features
    ğŸ’ Interactive DFA Building: Add states, set start/final states, and define transitions.
    ğŸ’ Step-by-Step DFA Execution: Enter strings and watch the DFA traverse states visually.
    ğŸ’ Visual Feedback: Active states are highlighted, and transitions are clearly drawn.
    ğŸ’ Supports Self-Loops & Multi-Symbol Transitions: Handles advanced DFA configurations.
    ğŸ’ Load & Save DFAs: Work with saved DFAs and try multiple strings.
    ğŸ’ Control Traversal: Step, run automatically, or pause anytime.

ğŸ–¥ How to Use
  1)Open the Website: Go to [DFA Visualizer Website](https://dfa-visualizer.vercel.app/) 
  2)Build a DFA:
    ğŸ’ Add states by clicking on the canvas.
    ğŸ’ Mark start and final states.
    ğŸ’ Add transitions between states. You can add multiple symbols using commas (e.g., a,b).
  3)Save Your DFA:
    ğŸ’ Save your DFA locally for later testing.
  4)Play Your DFA:
    ğŸ’ Go to the Play Page.
    ğŸ’ Select your saved DFA from the dropdown.
    ğŸ’ Enter an input string composed of symbols from your DFAâ€™s alphabet.
    ğŸ’ Click Start DFA to highlight the start state.
    ğŸ’ Pause anytime with the Pause button.
  5)View Results:
    ğŸ’ The website will alert whether the string is accepted or rejected.
    ğŸ’ Invalid symbols will trigger an error immediately.

âš¡ Tips
    ğŸ’ Only use symbols included in your DFAâ€™s alphabet for input strings.
    ğŸ’ Multi-symbol transitions should be comma-separated.
    ğŸ’ Self-loops are automatically visualized for clarity.
    ğŸ’ Make sure your states are named sequentially if planning to load and create new DFAs.
